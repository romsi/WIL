 Stay ahead of the best programming practices. Since iOS 4 major changes happen: ARC, storyboards, Swift and more. As an iOS engineer, we have to master the language, frameworks and the ecosystem.

 ## Swift 4.2

 Swift 4.2 is now officially released! Swift 4.2 builds on the strengths of Swift 4, delivering faster compile times, improving the debugging experience, updating the standard library, and converging on binary compatibility.

 You can watch a quick overview of it by watching the [WWDC 2018: Whatâ€™s New in Swift presentation](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/401/), and try out some of the new features in [Ole Begemann playground](https://github.com/ole/whats-new-in-swift-4-2).

 A quick overview of the new [Swift 4.2 features](Swift%204.2) using `XCTest`:
