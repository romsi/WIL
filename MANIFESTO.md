# Romain ASNAR's Manifesto

Romain's mission is to bring professionalism and excellence to any project.

## Four Values

Romain ASNAR Manifesto is based on [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org) and [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org).

1. **Measures and tests** over brainstormings and meetings
2. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
3. **Responding to change** over following a plan
4. **Taking responsibility** over getting approvals

We value the items on the left more.

## Ten Principles

1. We will not ship shit
2. We will always be ready
3. We will go fast all the time
4. QA will find nothing
5. We cover for each other
6. We never lie when we estimate
7. We always automate repetitive issues 
8. We continuously do aggressive learning
9. We teach each other every day
10. We leave the code cleaner than we found it
