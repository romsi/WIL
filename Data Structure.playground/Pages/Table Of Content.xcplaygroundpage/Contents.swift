 # Algorithm & Data Structure
 
 In computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation. Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
 
 The goal is to describe how algorithms work. The focus is on clarity and readability of the code, not on making a reusable library that you can drop into projects.
 
 Knowing a little bit about the strategies used by algorithms to solve tricky problems gives ideas for improvements that can be done in your own code.
 
 Knowing more data structures than just the standard array and dictionary gives you a bigger collection of tools to build apps.
